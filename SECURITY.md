## 1. Introduction & Security Philosophy

Proof-Messenger is designed with a **"security-in-depth"** philosophy. Our goal is to provide a robust authorization layer that is secure by default, minimizes the attack surface, and gives enterprises full control over their trust model.

This document outlines our approach to security by analyzing potential threats to each component of the Proof-Messenger ecosystem using the **STRIDE threat modeling framework**. It details both the inherent security properties of the protocol and the recommended best practices for implementers.

### Core Security Principles

1. **Zero Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal necessary access rights
4. **Fail Secure**: System fails to a secure state
5. **Privacy by Design**: Data protection built into the architecture
6. **Self-Hosted First**: Enterprise controls their own security perimeter - **you run the verifier, you control your data, you own your trust model**

### STRIDE Framework Overview

The **STRIDE** framework categorizes threats into six types:
- **Spoofing**: Impersonating something or someone else
- **Tampering**: Modifying data or code
- **Repudiation**: Claiming not to have performed an action
- **Information Disclosure**: Exposing information to unauthorized parties
- **Denial of Service**: Making a system or service unavailable
- **Elevation of Privilege**: Gaining capabilities without proper authorization

## 2. Use Case: End-to-End Integrity in Zero Trust Networks

### The Zero Trust Reality

Modern enterprise networks, guided by Zero Trust principles, assume that no part of the network is inherently secure. A key practice in these environments is **TLS Interception** (also known as SSL/TLS inspection or "SSL bumping"), where security appliances like next-generation firewalls, web application firewalls, and proxy servers decrypt and inspect traffic for threats.

While essential for security, this practice means that the **confidentiality of the communication channel cannot be guaranteed from end to end**. An administrator or a compromised network appliance could potentially view or even attempt to alter in-flight data.

### The Problem: Your Network is a "Man-in-the-Middle" by Design

```
[User Device] --TLS--> [Corporate Firewall] --TLS--> [Application Server]
                            |
                       [Decrypts & Inspects]
                       [Could Modify Data]
```

In this architecture:
- **TLS provides channel security** between segments, not end-to-end
- **Network appliances have plaintext access** to all application data
- **Malicious or misconfigured devices** could alter critical commands
- **Traditional audit logs** only show network-level events, not application intent

### The Solution: Application-Layer Integrity

**Proof-Messenger provides end-to-end integrity, even when the channel's confidentiality is compromised.**

The cryptographic signature within a proof is bound to the specific context of the business action (e.g., a payment amount, a system command). This signature is generated on the user's device and verified by the self-hosted Relay Server. Any modification of the context by an intermediary network device—malicious or otherwise—will cause the cryptographic verification to fail.

```
[User Device] --Signed Proof--> [Corporate Firewall] --Signed Proof--> [Application Server]
     |                               |                                        |
[Signs Context]                 [Inspects but                          [Verifies Signature]
                                Cannot Modify]                         [Detects Tampering]
```

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. User Action with Cryptographic Binding
```typescript
// User approves a wire transfer
const context = {
  action: "approve-wire-transfer",
  amount: 50000,
  recipient: "ACME-CORP-ACCOUNT-123",
  timestamp: "2024-07-14T10:30:00Z",
  user_id: "john.doe@company.com"
};

// Generate cryptographic proof on user's device
const proof = await proofMessenger.requestProof({ context });
// proof.signature is cryptographically bound to exact context
```

#### 2. Network Transit Through Inspection Points
```http
POST /api/execute-transfer HTTP/1.1
Host: banking.company.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "proof": {
    "context": {
      "action": "approve-wire-transfer",
      "amount": 50000,
      "recipient": "ACME-CORP-ACCOUNT-123",
      "timestamp": "2024-07-14T10:30:00Z",
      "user_id": "john.doe@company.com"
    },
    "signature": "MEUCIQDxK8rF2vN3mJ4pL6qR8sT9uV0wX1yZ2aB3cD4eF5gH6i...",
    "publicKey": "MCowBQYDK2VwAyEAm4f8Tv6nF2vN3mJ4pL6qR8sT9uV0wX1yZ...",
    "algorithm": "Ed25519"
  }
}
```

**Network appliances can:**
- ✅ Inspect the JSON structure for threats
- ✅ Log the transaction details for compliance
- ✅ Apply security policies based on content
- ❌ **Cannot modify context without breaking signature**

#### 3. Server-Side Verification
```typescript
// Application server verifies proof integrity
const verification = await proofMessenger.verifyProof(proof);

if (!verification.valid) {
  // Signature verification failed - context was tampered with
  throw new Error('Proof verification failed - possible tampering detected');
}

// Execute action with cryptographic certainty
await executeWireTransfer(verification.context);
```

### Security Guarantees

#### **End-to-End Integrity**
- **Tamper Detection**: Any modification to the context breaks the signature
- **Non-Repudiation**: User cannot deny approving the exact context
- **Replay Protection**: Timestamps and nonces prevent replay attacks
- **Identity Binding**: Proof is cryptographically tied to user's identity

#### **Network Inspection Compatibility**
- **Full Visibility**: Network devices can inspect all proof contents
- **Policy Enforcement**: Security rules can be applied to proof data
- **Threat Detection**: Malicious payloads in context are detectable
- **Compliance Logging**: Complete audit trail at network and application layers

#### **Compromise Resilience**
- **Compromised Network Device**: Cannot forge valid proofs
- **Malicious Administrator**: Cannot alter user intent without detection
- **MITM Attacks**: Signature verification detects tampering
- **Insider Threats**: Cryptographic proof prevents unauthorized modifications

### Enterprise Benefits

#### **For CISOs**
- **Maintain Network Security**: Continue TLS inspection and threat detection
- **Add Application Integrity**: Cryptographic proof of user intent
- **Reduce Insider Risk**: Network administrators cannot forge user actions
- **Compliance Ready**: Immutable audit trail of user authorizations

#### **For Security Architects**
- **Zero Trust Compatible**: Assumes network compromise, provides application-layer security
- **Defense in Depth**: Adds cryptographic layer above network security
- **Incident Response**: Clear evidence of tampering vs. legitimate actions
- **Risk Reduction**: Mathematical proof reduces authorization disputes

#### **For Compliance Officers**
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Cryptographic proof meets audit requirements
- **Non-Repudiation**: Users cannot deny specific authorizations
- **Audit Trail**: Complete record of user intent and system execution
- **Evidence Quality**: Legally admissible cryptographic proof

### Real-World Scenarios

#### **Scenario 1: Compromised Proxy Server**
```
Problem: A proxy server is compromised and attempts to modify wire transfer amounts
Solution: Signature verification fails, transaction is blocked, incident is logged
Result: Attack is detected and prevented automatically
```

#### **Scenario 2: Malicious Network Administrator**
```
Problem: Insider threat attempts to alter critical system commands
Solution: Cryptographic signature cannot be forged without user's private key
Result: Unauthorized modifications are mathematically impossible
```

#### **Scenario 3: Regulatory Audit**
```
Problem: Auditors need proof that users actually authorized specific actions
Solution: Cryptographic proofs provide non-repudiable evidence of user intent
Result: Audit passes with mathematical certainty of compliance
```

### Implementation Considerations

#### **Network Architecture**
- **TLS Inspection**: Continue existing security practices
- **Proxy Configuration**: No changes needed for proof transit
- **Firewall Rules**: Standard HTTP/HTTPS traffic patterns
- **Load Balancers**: Proof objects are stateless and cacheable

#### **Security Monitoring**
- **SIEM Integration**: Proof verification events in security logs
- **Anomaly Detection**: Failed verification indicates tampering attempts
- **Incident Response**: Clear distinction between network and application issues
- **Forensics**: Cryptographic evidence for investigation

#### **Performance Impact**
- **Minimal Overhead**: Signature verification is computationally lightweight
- **Caching**: Proof verification results can be cached
- **Scalability**: Stateless verification scales horizontally
- **Latency**: Sub-millisecond verification time

### Conclusion

This approach allows enterprises to continue their essential network traffic inspection while adding a **non-repudiable layer of application-level integrity**, ensuring that the commands executed by the backend are cryptographically identical to the commands authorized by the user.

**Key Message**: *TLS secures the channel. Proof-Messenger secures the command.*

You get the best of both worlds: **network security inspection AND application-level non-repudiation**.

## 3. Threat Model by Component

We analyze the system as four distinct components:

1. **The Client-Side Protocol Crate (WASM Module)**: The core cryptographic engine running in the user's browser
2. **The Integrating Application Frontend**: The customer's web application that uses the WASM module
3. **The Integrating Application Backend**: The customer's server that initiates workflows
4. **The Relay Server**: The verification oracle that validates proofs

### 2.1 Client-Side Protocol Crate (WASM Module)

This component is responsible for generating keys and signing the context. It runs in the highly sandboxed environment of a web browser.

#### 🎭 Spoofing Identity

**Threat**: A malicious script attempts to generate a proof by spoofing a user's identity.

**Mitigation**: This is inherently prevented by the core design. Private keys are managed by the browser/OS security layer (e.g., Secure Enclave, TPM, WebAuthn) and are not directly accessible to JavaScript or the WASM module. A proof can only be generated with physical user interaction (e.g., biometric tap, PIN), which releases the private key for a single signing operation.

**Risk Level**: 🟢 **LOW** - Cryptographically impossible with proper WebAuthn implementation

**Additional Controls**:
- WebAuthn API enforces user presence verification
- Hardware security modules (HSM) protect private keys
- Browser sandbox prevents direct memory access
- Attestation mechanisms verify authentic hardware

#### 🔧 Tampering with Context

**Threat**: The context data is altered after the user has approved it but before it is signed.

**Mitigation**: The WASM module signs the exact byte representation of the context it receives. It is the responsibility of the Integrating Application Frontend to ensure **"What You See Is What You Sign" (WYSIWYS)**. Our SDK documentation mandates that the context is displayed clearly and that no changes are possible between user approval and the call to the signing function.

**Risk Level**: 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Depends on frontend implementation quality

**Additional Controls**:
- Cryptographic hash verification of context before signing
- Immutable context objects in JavaScript
- Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent script injection
- Subresource Integrity (SRI) for all loaded scripts
- Real-time context validation in WASM module

**Implementation Requirements**:
```rust
// Context must be cryptographically hashed before signing
let context_hash = sha256(&context_bytes);
let signature = sign_with_webauthn(context_hash, user_credential);
```

#### 🚫 Repudiation

**Threat**: A user successfully creates a proof but later claims they did not authorize the action.

**Mitigation**: This is the primary threat that Proof-Messenger is designed to solve. The resulting cryptographic signature on the specific context provides **non-repudiable proof** that the user's private key was used to authorize that exact transaction.

**Risk Level**: 🟢 **LOW** - Core security guarantee of the system

**Additional Controls**:
- Immutable audit logs with timestamps
- Cryptographic proof of user presence during signing
- Context includes sufficient detail for legal verification
- Integration with enterprise identity systems
- Compliance with digital signature regulations (eIDAS, ESIGN Act)

#### 🔓 Information Disclosure (Private Key Leakage)

**Threat**: An attacker attempts to extract the user's private key from the WASM module's memory.

**Mitigation**: The private key **never enters the WASM memory heap**. All cryptographic operations are delegated to the browser's WebAuthn API, which communicates with the underlying OS/hardware security module. For any other transient sensitive data, our Rust code leverages the `zeroize` crate to securely wipe it from memory as soon as it is no longer needed.

**Risk Level**: 🟢 **LOW** - Hardware-backed key protection

**Additional Controls**:
```rust
use zeroize::{Zeroize, ZeroizeOnDrop};

#[derive(ZeroizeOnDrop)]
struct SensitiveData {
    secret: [u8; 32],
}

impl Drop for SensitiveData {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        self.secret.zeroize();
    }
}
```

- Memory protection using `zeroize` crate
- No sensitive data in WASM linear memory
- Hardware security module integration
- Secure memory allocation patterns
- Regular security audits of memory handling

#### 💥 Denial of Service

**Threat**: An attacker feeds malformed data to the WASM module, causing it to crash or enter an infinite loop.

**Mitigation**: The Rust code is built with robust error handling (using `Result<T, E>`) to gracefully handle invalid inputs. The impact of a crash is limited to a single browser tab and can be resolved with a page refresh.

**Risk Level**: 🟢 **LOW** - Limited blast radius, easy recovery

**Additional Controls**:
```rust
pub fn process_context(input: &str) -> Result<SignedContext, ProcessingError> {
    let context = serde_json::from_str(input)
        .map_err(|e| ProcessingError::InvalidJson(e))?;
    
    validate_context(&context)?;
    sign_context(context)
}
```

- Comprehensive input validation
- Resource limits and timeouts
- Graceful error handling with detailed logging
- Circuit breaker patterns for repeated failures
- Monitoring and alerting for unusual patterns

#### ⬆️ Elevation of Privilege

**Threat**: The WASM module attempts to perform actions outside its intended scope.

**Mitigation**: **Not applicable**. The WASM module runs in a strict browser sandbox with no access to the file system, network (by default), or other system resources. Its only privilege is to request a signing operation via the browser's secure API, which itself requires user consent.

**Risk Level**: 🟢 **LOW** - Browser sandbox provides strong isolation

**Additional Controls**:
- WASM sandbox enforces strict capability model
- No direct system calls available
- Limited to WebAuthn API interactions only
- Content Security Policy restrictions
- Regular security reviews of WASM permissions

### 2.2 Integrating Application Frontend

This is the customer's code. Our role is to provide secure SDKs and clear guidance.

#### 🔧 Tampering with Context (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS)

**Threat**: An XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to inject a script that displays a benign context to the user (e.g., "Approve $10 payment") while sending a malicious context to the signing module (e.g., "Approve $10,000 payment").

**Mitigation**: This is a **critical threat**. Our integration documentation mandates the implementation of a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent the execution of unauthorized scripts. We also provide guidance on secure coding practices to prevent XSS vulnerabilities in the first place.

**Risk Level**: 🔴 **HIGH** - Can completely compromise transaction integrity

**Required Security Controls**:

1. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**:
```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="
    default-src 'self';
    script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://trusted-cdn.com;
    object-src 'none';
    base-uri 'self';
    frame-ancestors 'none';
">
```

2. **Input Sanitization**:
```javascript
// Always sanitize user input
const sanitizedInput = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);

// Use parameterized queries for database operations
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?';
db.query(query, [userId]);
```

3. **Context Integrity Verification**:
```javascript
// Verify context hasn't been tampered with
const contextHash = await crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', 
    new TextEncoder().encode(JSON.stringify(context))
);

// Display hash to user for verification
displayContextHash(contextHash);
```

**Additional Controls**:
- Subresource Integrity (SRI) for all external scripts
- Regular security scanning and penetration testing
- Input validation and output encoding
- Use of security-focused frameworks (React with proper escaping)
- Implementation of CSRF tokens
- Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning

#### 🎭 Spoofing (Session Hijacking)

**Threat**: An attacker hijacks a user's session to perform unauthorized actions.

**Mitigation**: Implement secure session management with proper authentication and authorization checks.

**Risk Level**: 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Standard web application security concern

**Required Controls**:
- Secure session tokens with proper entropy
- HTTPOnly and Secure cookie flags
- Session timeout and renewal
- Multi-factor authentication where appropriate
- IP address and user agent validation

#### 🔓 Information Disclosure (Data Leakage)

**Threat**: Sensitive information is exposed through client-side code or network traffic.

**Mitigation**: Follow data minimization principles and implement proper access controls.

**Risk Level**: 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Depends on data sensitivity

**Required Controls**:
- HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- Data classification and handling procedures
- Minimal data exposure in client-side code
- Proper error handling without information leakage
- Regular security audits of data flows

### 2.3 Integrating Application Backend

The customer's server infrastructure that initiates proof workflows.

#### 🔧 Tampering with Proof Requests

**Threat**: An attacker modifies proof requests before they reach the user.

**Mitigation**: Implement request signing and integrity verification.

**Risk Level**: 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Can be mitigated with proper implementation

**Required Controls**:
```python
# Example: Request signing
import hmac
import hashlib

def sign_request(request_data, secret_key):
    signature = hmac.new(
        secret_key.encode(),
        request_data.encode(),
        hashlib.sha256
    ).hexdigest()
    return signature

def verify_request(request_data, signature, secret_key):
    expected_signature = sign_request(request_data, secret_key)
    return hmac.compare_digest(signature, expected_signature)
```

#### 🔓 Information Disclosure (Database Compromise)

**Threat**: Sensitive data is exposed through database vulnerabilities.

**Mitigation**: Implement database security best practices and data encryption.

**Risk Level**: 🔴 **HIGH** - Can expose large amounts of sensitive data

**Required Controls**:
- Database encryption at rest and in transit
- Proper access controls and authentication
- Regular security updates and patches
- Database activity monitoring
- Backup encryption and secure storage
- Data retention and deletion policies

#### ⬆️ Elevation of Privilege (API Vulnerabilities)

**Threat**: Attackers exploit API vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access.

**Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive API security measures.

**Risk Level**: 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Standard API security concerns

**Required Controls**:
- API authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Input validation and sanitization
- Proper error handling
- API versioning and deprecation policies
- Regular security testing

### 2.4 The Relay Server

This is the core verification component, designed to be run by the enterprise in their own infrastructure ("self-hosted first").

#### 🎭 Spoofing a Valid Proof

**Threat**: An attacker submits a fraudulent proof and attempts to have it validated.

**Mitigation**: **Inherently prevented**. The Relay Server performs rigorous cryptographic verification of the signature against the public key and the context. Any tampering, no matter how small, will invalidate the signature.

**Risk Level**: 🟢 **LOW** - Cryptographically impossible

**Verification Process**:
```rust
pub fn verify_proof(proof: &Proof) -> Result<VerificationResult, VerificationError> {
    // 1. Verify signature format and structure
    validate_signature_format(&proof.signature)?;
    
    // 2. Verify public key authenticity
    verify_public_key(&proof.public_key)?;
    
    // 3. Reconstruct signed context
    let context_hash = hash_context(&proof.context);
    
    // 4. Verify cryptographic signature
    verify_signature(&proof.signature, &context_hash, &proof.public_key)?;
    
    // 5. Verify timestamp and replay protection
    verify_timestamp(&proof.timestamp)?;
    check_replay_protection(&proof.nonce)?;
    
    Ok(VerificationResult::Valid)
}
```

#### 🔧 Tampering with Logs

**Threat**: An administrator or attacker with access to the Relay Server attempts to modify the audit logs to hide a fraudulent transaction.

**Mitigation**: The Relay Server should be configured to output to an **append-only, write-immutable log stream** (e.g., AWS CloudWatch Logs, Google Cloud Logging, or a local file system with immutable flags). This makes tampering evident.

**Risk Level**: 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Depends on deployment configuration

**Required Controls**:
```rust
// Example: Immutable logging with cryptographic integrity
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use sha2::{Sha256, Digest};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct LogEntry {
    timestamp: u64,
    event_type: String,
    data: serde_json::Value,
    previous_hash: String,
    current_hash: String,
}

impl LogEntry {
    fn new(event_type: String, data: serde_json::Value, previous_hash: String) -> Self {
        let timestamp = SystemTime::now()
            .duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH)
            .unwrap()
            .as_secs();
        
        let mut entry = LogEntry {
            timestamp,
            event_type,
            data,
            previous_hash,
            current_hash: String::new(),
        };
        
        entry.current_hash = entry.calculate_hash();
        entry
    }
    
    fn calculate_hash(&self) -> String {
        let mut hasher = Sha256::new();
        hasher.update(self.timestamp.to_string());
        hasher.update(&self.event_type);
        hasher.update(serde_json::to_string(&self.data).unwrap());
        hasher.update(&self.previous_hash);
        format!("{:x}", hasher.finalize())
    }
}
```

**Additional Controls**:
- Write-only log permissions
- Log integrity verification
- External log backup and archival
- Blockchain anchoring for critical logs
- Regular log integrity audits

#### 🚫 Repudiation by Operator

**Threat**: The operator of the Relay Server denies that a specific proof was ever verified.

**Mitigation**: The secure, append-only logging provides a high degree of confidence. For extreme trust requirements, the Relay Server can be designed to periodically hash its log file and publish that hash to a public blockchain or other immutable ledger.

**Risk Level**: 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Can be reduced with additional controls

**Enhanced Controls**:
```rust
// Blockchain anchoring for log integrity
pub struct BlockchainAnchor {
    blockchain_client: BlockchainClient,
    anchor_interval: Duration,
}

impl BlockchainAnchor {
    pub async fn anchor_logs(&self, log_hash: &str) -> Result<TransactionId, AnchorError> {
        let transaction = self.blockchain_client
            .create_transaction(log_hash)
            .await?;
        
        Ok(transaction.id)
    }
}
```

- Periodic blockchain anchoring
- Third-party log attestation services
- Multi-party log verification
- Cryptographic timestamping
- Legal framework for digital evidence

#### 🔓 Information Disclosure

**Threat**: An attacker gains access to the Relay Server and exfiltrates the context data from verified proofs.

**Mitigation**: This is a **significant threat**. The primary mitigation is our **"self-hosted first"** governance model. The enterprise controls the server and is responsible for securing it using standard best practices. The protocol itself minimizes risk by not requiring any user PII beyond what is necessary for the context itself.

**Risk Level**: 🔴 **HIGH** - Potential for large-scale data exposure

**Required Security Controls**:

1. **Infrastructure Security**:
```yaml
# Example: Kubernetes security configuration
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsNonRoot: true
    runAsUser: 1000
    fsGroup: 2000
  containers:
  - name: relay-server
    securityContext:
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
      readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
      capabilities:
        drop:
        - ALL
```

2. **Data Encryption**:
```rust
// Encrypt sensitive data at rest
use aes_gcm::{Aes256Gcm, Key, Nonce};
use aes_gcm::aead::{Aead, NewAead};

pub struct EncryptedStorage {
    cipher: Aes256Gcm,
}

impl EncryptedStorage {
    pub fn encrypt_context(&self, context: &str) -> Result<Vec<u8>, EncryptionError> {
        let nonce = Nonce::from_slice(b"unique nonce"); // Use proper nonce generation
        self.cipher.encrypt(nonce, context.as_bytes())
            .map_err(|e| EncryptionError::EncryptionFailed(e))
    }
}
```

3. **Access Controls**:
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-factor authentication for administrators
- Network segmentation and firewalls
- VPN access for remote administration
- Regular access reviews and deprovisioning

4. **Monitoring and Alerting**:
- Real-time intrusion detection
- Anomaly detection for unusual access patterns
- Security information and event management (SIEM)
- Regular vulnerability assessments
- Incident response procedures

#### 💥 Denial of Service

**Threat**: An attacker floods the Relay Server with a high volume of invalid proofs, consuming CPU resources with expensive cryptographic verifications.

**Mitigation**: This is a **critical operational threat**. The Relay Server must be deployed with multiple layers of protection.

**Risk Level**: 🔴 **HIGH** - Can render service unavailable

**Required Protection Layers**:

1. **Rate Limiting**:
```rust
use governor::{Quota, RateLimiter};
use std::num::NonZeroU32;

pub struct RateLimitedVerifier {
    limiter: RateLimiter<String, DashMap<String, InMemoryState>, DefaultClock>,
}

impl RateLimitedVerifier {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        let quota = Quota::per_second(NonZeroU32::new(10).unwrap());
        Self {
            limiter: RateLimiter::keyed(quota),
        }
    }
    
    pub fn verify_with_rate_limit(&self, client_id: &str, proof: &Proof) 
        -> Result<VerificationResult, VerificationError> {
        
        if self.limiter.check_key(client_id).is_err() {
            return Err(VerificationError::RateLimitExceeded);
        }
        
        self.verify_proof(proof)
    }
}
```

2. **Input Validation Pipeline**:
```rust
pub fn validate_proof_request(request: &ProofRequest) -> Result<(), ValidationError> {
    // Fast checks first (cheap operations)
    validate_json_structure(request)?;
    validate_field_lengths(request)?;
    validate_required_fields(request)?;
    
    // Format validation
    validate_signature_format(&request.signature)?;
    validate_public_key_format(&request.public_key)?;
    
    // Only proceed to expensive crypto operations if basic validation passes
    Ok(())
}
```

3. **Horizontal Scalability**:
```yaml
# Kubernetes horizontal pod autoscaler
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: relay-server-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: relay-server
  minReplicas: 3
  maxReplicas: 50
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
```

4. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**:
```rust
use circuit_breaker::CircuitBreaker;

pub struct ProtectedVerifier {
    circuit_breaker: CircuitBreaker,
    verifier: CryptoVerifier,
}

impl ProtectedVerifier {
    pub fn verify(&self, proof: &Proof) -> Result<VerificationResult, VerificationError> {

```

#### ⬆️ Elevation of Privilege

**Threat**: An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Relay Server or its OS to gain root access.

**Mitigation**: The Relay Server is built in Rust, which prevents entire classes of memory safety vulnerabilities. It should be run as an unprivileged user in a containerized environment with a minimal base image to further reduce the attack surface.

**Risk Level**: 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Reduced by Rust's memory safety

**Security Hardening**:

1. **Container Security**:
```dockerfile
# Minimal base image
FROM scratch

# Copy only necessary files
COPY relay-server /relay-server

# Run as non-root user
USER 65534:65534

# Expose only necessary port
EXPOSE 8080

ENTRYPOINT ["/relay-server"]
```

2. **System Hardening**:
```bash
# Disable unnecessary services
systemctl disable bluetooth
systemctl disable cups
systemctl disable avahi-daemon

# Configure firewall
ufw default deny incoming
ufw default allow outgoing
ufw allow 22/tcp  # SSH
ufw allow 8080/tcp  # Relay server
ufw enable

# Set up fail2ban
apt-get install fail2ban
systemctl enable fail2ban
```

3. **Runtime Security**:
```rust
// Drop privileges after startup
use nix::unistd::{setuid, setgid, Uid, Gid};

fn drop_privileges() -> Result<(), SecurityError> {
    let nobody_uid = Uid::from_raw(65534);
    let nobody_gid = Gid::from_raw(65534);
    
    setgid(nobody_gid)?;
    setuid(nobody_uid)?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## 4. Security Best Practices

### 4.1 Development Security

#### Secure Coding Standards
```rust
// Example: Secure input validation
use validator::{Validate, ValidationError};

#[derive(Validate)]
struct ProofRequest {
    #[validate(length(min = 1, max = 1000))]
    context: String,
    
    #[validate(custom = "validate_signature")]
    signature: String,
    
    #[validate(custom = "validate_public_key")]
    public_key: String,
}

fn validate_signature(signature: &str) -> Result<(), ValidationError> {
    // Implement signature format validation
    if signature.len() < 64 || signature.len() > 128 {
        return Err(ValidationError::new("invalid_signature_length"));
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

#### Dependency Management
```toml
# Cargo.toml - Pin dependencies for security
[dependencies]
serde = "=1.0.193"
tokio = "=1.35.1"
ring = "=0.17.7"

# Use cargo-audit for vulnerability scanning
[dev-dependencies]
cargo-audit = "0.20.0"
```

#### Testing Security
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod security_tests {
    use super::*;
    
    #[test]
    fn test_malformed_input_handling() {
        let malformed_inputs = vec![
            "", // Empty input
            "x".repeat(1_000_000), // Oversized input
            "\x00\x01\x02", // Binary data
            "{'invalid': json}", // Malformed JSON
        ];
        
        for input in malformed_inputs {
            let result = process_input(&input);
            assert!(result.is_err(), "Should reject malformed input: {}", input);
        }
    }
    
    #[test]
    fn test_timing_attack_resistance() {
        let valid_signature = "valid_signature_here";
        let invalid_signature = "invalid_signature_here";
        
        let start = Instant::now();
        let _ = verify_signature(valid_signature);
        let valid_time = start.elapsed();
        
        let start = Instant::now();
        let _ = verify_signature(invalid_signature);
        let invalid_time = start.elapsed();
        
        // Timing should be similar to prevent timing attacks
        let time_diff = valid_time.abs_diff(invalid_time);
        assert!(time_diff < Duration::from_millis(10));
    }
}
```

### 4.2 Deployment Security

#### Infrastructure as Code
```yaml
# terraform/security.tf

    to_port     = 443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["10.0.0.0/8"] # Internal network only
  }
  
  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

resource "aws_kms_key" "relay_server_encryption" {
  description             = "KMS key for Relay Server encryption"
  deletion_window_in_days = 7
  
  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Effect = "Allow"
        Principal = {
          AWS = "arn:aws:iam::${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}:root"
        }
        Action = "kms:*"
        Resource = "*"
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

#### Monitoring and Alerting
```yaml
