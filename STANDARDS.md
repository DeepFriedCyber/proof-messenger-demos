## 1. Our Philosophy on Open Standards

Proof-Messenger is built on a foundation of **open and proven technologies**, from the underlying cryptography to the WebAssembly runtime environment. We believe that open standards are the bedrock of a secure, interoperable, and innovative internet.

The purpose of this document is to clarify our position relative to existing and emerging digital identity standards and to outline our philosophy for future engagement with standards bodies like the **W3C**, **IETF**, **FIDO Alliance**, and **OpenID Foundation**.

### Our Standards Philosophy

**🎯 Standards Should Emerge from Proven Implementations**  
We believe that successful standards emerge from proven, real-world implementations that solve demonstrated market needs. Our current focus is on validating the core protocol and achieving product-market fit to solve a specific, urgent enterprise need.

**🤝 Collaboration Over Competition**  
We view existing standards as complementary technologies that can work together to create a more secure and user-friendly digital ecosystem. Our goal is to be a good ecosystem citizen and contribute meaningfully to the broader identity community.

**🔄 Iterative Refinement**  
Standards should evolve through iterative refinement based on real-world deployment experience, security research, and community feedback. We are committed to this process of continuous improvement.

**🌐 Interoperability First**  
Any future standardization efforts should prioritize interoperability and avoid vendor lock-in. We are designing Proof-Messenger with this principle in mind from the ground up.

**🏢 Self-Hosted Governance**  
We believe enterprises must maintain control over their authorization infrastructure. Our "self-hosted first" approach ensures that organizations own their trust model and control their data, which is essential for both security and standards compliance.

## 2. Our Core Focus: Verifiable Transactional Intent

To understand our relationship with other standards, it is critical to understand our **specific focus**. Proof-Messenger is designed to solve the problem of **verifiable transactional intent**.

### The Authorization Gap in Current Standards

| Standard Category | Primary Question | Example Use Cases | Limitations |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Identity Standards** (VCs/DIDs) | "Who are you?" or "What are you qualified for?" | Professional credentials, age verification, membership status | Static attributes, not transaction-specific |
| **Authentication Standards** (WebAuthn/FIDO) | "Can you prove you control this key/device?" | Login, device binding, session establishment | Binary yes/no, lacks transaction context |
| **Authorization Standards** (OAuth 2.0/OIDC) | "What resources can you access?" | API access, resource permissions, scope-based access | Coarse-grained, session-level permissions |
| **🎯 Proof-Messenger** | **"Did you provide non-repudiable approval for this specific transaction?"** | **Wire transfers, contract signing, privileged operations** | **Fine-grained, context-aware, non-repudiable** |

### Our Unique Value Proposition

**🔐 Transactional Context Binding**  
Unlike authentication (which proves identity) or traditional authorization (which grants access), Proof-Messenger creates cryptographic proof that a specific user approved a specific transaction with full knowledge of its details.

**⚡ Dynamic, In-Session Authorization**  
While VCs prove static attributes and WebAuthn proves key control, Proof-Messenger focuses on authorizing dynamic, in-session actions with rich contextual information.

**📋 Non-Repudiation by Design**  
The cryptographic signature is bound to the exact transaction details, making it impossible for users to later claim they didn't approve the specific action.

**🏢 Enterprise-Grade Auditability**  
Every proof includes sufficient context for compliance auditing and legal verification, addressing enterprise requirements that existing standards don't fully address.

## 3. Relationship to Key Standards & Technologies

### 3.1 W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs) & Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

**🤝 Complementary, Not Competitive**

VCs and DIDs are powerful emerging standards for portable, user-centric identity. They allow users to hold and present cryptographically verifiable "claims" about themselves (e.g., "I have a driver's license," "I am an employee of Acme Corp.").

**Proof-Messenger is complementary to, not competitive with, VCs and DIDs.**

#### Different Jobs to Be Done

| Aspect | Verifiable Credentials | Proof-Messenger |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Purpose** | Prove user attributes/qualifications | Prove transaction approval |
| **Timing** | Static, long-lived claims | Dynamic, moment-in-time actions |
| **Content** | Identity attributes, credentials | Transaction context, business logic |
| **Verification** | Attribute validity | Intent and approval |
| **Lifecycle** | Issued, held, presented | Generated, signed, verified |

#### Potential for Powerful Synergy

The two systems can work together in sophisticated workflows:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant App
    participant VC_Verifier
    participant ProofMessenger
    participant RelayServer
    
    User->>App: Initiate high-value transaction
    App->>VC_Verifier: Request employee credential
    User->>VC_Verifier: Present employee VC
    VC_Verifier->>App: Verify: User is authorized employee
    App->>ProofMessenger: Request transaction approval
    Note over ProofMessenger: VC can be included in signed context
    User->>ProofMessenger: Approve specific transaction
    ProofMessenger->>RelayServer: Submit proof with VC context
    RelayServer->>App: Verified: Employee approved $50K transfer
```

**Example Integration Scenario:**
1. **Identity Verification**: User presents a VC proving they are an authorized financial officer
2. **Transaction Authorization**: User then uses Proof-Messenger to approve a specific $50,000 wire transfer
3. **Audit Trail**: The Proof-Messenger context includes both the transaction details AND the presented VC for complete auditability

#### Technical Integration Points

```json
{
  "proof_messenger_context": {
    "transaction": {
      "type": "wire_transfer",
      "amount_usd_cents": 5000000,
      "destination": "ACME-CORP-ACCOUNT"
    },
    "authorization_context": {
      "presented_credentials": [
        {

          },
          "proof": {
            "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
            "verificationMethod": "did:example:123#key-1"
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

### 3.2 FIDO Alliance / WebAuthn

**🏗️ WebAuthn as Our Foundation Layer**

As stated in our architecture documentation, we consider **WebAuthn and passkeys to be the foundational Layer 1** for authentication. Proof-Messenger is designed as a **Layer 2 for authorization**.

#### Layered Security Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Layer 3: Business Logic & Compliance                       │
│ • Audit logging • Policy enforcement • Regulatory compliance│
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Layer 2: Transaction Authorization (Proof-Messenger)       │
│ • Context-aware approval • Non-repudiation • Intent proof  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Layer 1: User Authentication (WebAuthn/FIDO)              │
│ • Identity verification • Device binding • Session establishment│
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Layer 0: Cryptographic Primitives                         │
│ • Hardware security modules • Secure enclaves • Key management│
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Integration with WebAuthn

**Authentication First**: We assume and recommend that users are first authenticated into a session using a strong, standards-based mechanism like a passkey.

**Authorization Next**: Proof-Messenger is then invoked within that secure session to authorize specific, high-risk actions that require more granular and context-aware proof than the initial login provides.

```javascript
// Example: WebAuthn + Proof-Messenger Integration
class SecureTransactionFlow {
    async executeHighValueTransaction(transactionDetails) {
        // Layer 1: Ensure user is authenticated via WebAuthn
        if (!await this.verifyWebAuthnSession()) {
            throw new Error("User must be authenticated via WebAuthn first");
        }
        
        // Layer 2: Get specific authorization for this transaction
        const proof = await this.proofMessenger.requestApproval({
            context: transactionDetails,
            requireUserPresence: true,
            includeSessionContext: true
        });
        
        // Layer 3: Execute transaction with cryptographic proof
        return await this.executeTransaction(transactionDetails, proof);
    }
}
```

#### Alignment with FIDO Alliance Goals

| FIDO Alliance Goal | How Proof-Messenger Supports |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| **Passwordless Authentication** | Builds on WebAuthn foundation, never requires passwords |
| **Phishing Resistance** | Context binding prevents transaction manipulation attacks |
| **User Privacy** | No PII required beyond transaction context |
| **Interoperability** | Works with any WebAuthn-compliant authenticator |
| **Scalability** | Designed for enterprise-scale deployment |

### 3.3 OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect (OIDC)

**🔗 Complementary Authorization Patterns**

OAuth 2.0 and OIDC excel at **resource-based authorization** (what APIs can you access?) while Proof-Messenger focuses on **transaction-based authorization** (did you approve this specific action?).

#### Different Authorization Models

| Aspect | OAuth 2.0/OIDC | Proof-Messenger |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Granularity** | Resource/scope level | Transaction level |
| **Duration** | Session/token lifetime | Single-use, moment-in-time |
| **Context** | Resource access permissions | Rich transaction details |
| **Revocation** | Token revocation | Cannot be revoked (non-repudiation) |
| **Audit** | Access logs | Cryptographic proof |

#### Potential Integration Scenarios

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant AuthServer
    participant ResourceServer
    participant ProofMessenger
    
    Client->>AuthServer: Request OAuth token
    AuthServer->>Client: Access token (scope: financial_operations)
    Client->>ResourceServer: Access financial API
    ResourceServer->>Client: Return account data
    
    Note over Client,ResourceServer: High-value operation requires additional proof
    
    Client->>ProofMessenger: Request transaction approval
    ProofMessenger->>Client: Cryptographic proof of approval
    Client->>ResourceServer: Execute transaction + proof
    ResourceServer->>ResourceServer: Verify proof via Relay Server
```

### 3.4 IETF & W3C Standards Bodies

**🏛️ Deep Respect for Standards Bodies**

We hold the work of the **Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)** and the **World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)** in the highest regard. These bodies are the proper venues for formalizing new internet-scale protocols.
