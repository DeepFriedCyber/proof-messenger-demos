# "Self-Hosted First" Governance Model Implementation

## 🎯 **Mission Accomplished: Clear Enterprise Messaging**

We have successfully implemented comprehensive "Self-Hosted First" messaging across all key technical assets to address the critical enterprise concern about trust models and data sovereignty.

## 📋 **Core Message Implemented**

**"You run the verifier. You control your data. You own your trust model."**

This message has been strategically inserted across all documentation to make it immediately obvious that Proof-Messenger is **not a SaaS service** that requires enterprises to send sensitive data to third parties.

### **After Implementation**
✅ **Crystal Clear Messaging**: "You run the verifier" appears prominently
✅ **Enterprise Confidence**: Clear data sovereignty guarantees
✅ **Security Assurance**: Complete control over verification environment
✅ **Compliance Alignment**: All data remains within enterprise boundary

## 📊 **Documentation Coverage Matrix**

|----------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **README.md** | ✅ Prominent section | ✅ Key benefits | ✅ Basic examples |
| **Relay README.md** | ✅ Deployment focus | ✅ Security guidelines | ✅ Docker/K8s examples |
| **TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md** | ✅ Comprehensive | ✅ Full architecture | ✅ Production examples |
| **SECURITY.md** | ✅ Core principle | ✅ Security implications | ✅ Threat model |
| **STANDARDS.md** | ✅ Philosophy | ✅ Standards alignment | ✅ Governance model |

## 🚀 **Key Messages Successfully Deployed**

### **1. Data Privacy Guarantee**
